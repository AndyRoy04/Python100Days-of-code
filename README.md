# Hey everyone, I'm Anderson Roy and I'll be uploading my 100days of python code challenge in this repository. 
# So if you're interested in learning, you can go through the various daily challenges and learn something new

## Every single day we do different task and Projects. So below you'll see main task of each day of challenge


# Day1 : Band Name Generator 👩🏿‍🤝‍👨🏿
## You enter your pets' name and the city you grew up in and then you get a band name
## Here I mostly did introduction to variables and worked some basic functions.

# Day2 : tip calculator 🧮
## The tip calculator tells you the amount of money you want to give away amybe to servers in a restaurant based on your input percentail and also tells how much everyone is to pay. So the magic behind is :
## Imagine going out with friends and you guys are given a final bill to pay and you decide to donate some money, so it calculates the tip by taking the percentile give away of you final amount, calculates the final amount to be payed by adding the tip to it and tells how much everyone is to pay.
## I also built a BMI(Body Mass Index) calculator and a life in weeks prediction. This ones were just interactive task but fun 😊
## Here I understood data types and how to manipulate strings

# Day3 : Treasure Island  Game🗺️
## The treasure island is game that prompts the user to make choice from some given options and based on the users choice, it tells if he can moved forward or if he/she has crashed.
# Additional tasks were ## Love Calculator which gives th amtching percentage of 2 individuals
# My first pizza calculator
# Updated the BMI calculator, A leap yaer predictor and Roller coster Game.
## I was dealing with control flow, Logical operators and conditional statements

# Day4 : Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊🏿🤚🏿✌🏿
## I'm preety sure everyone knows how the Rock, Paper, Scissors game functions but in this case you play with the computer. You'll find the main code and the commented code which all perform same task
# I also Built a ## Head or Coin game
# A Pay bill game where you enter a list of people and the computer randomly chooses who pays the final bill
# Also, I built a treasure guess game where the user guesses where the treasure was placed
## Here I mostly learned about python lists and randomisation

# Day5 : Random Password Generator 🕳️❓
## From the name, you should already guess what it does. We always get things like people hacked into our accounts and all other things dealing with unethical hacking. So I thought and thought on my todays challenge and decided to share this amazing program with you. In this program, you choose the number letters, numbers and symbols you want in your password and random password is generated every single time you ask. So what do you think about this, changing all your easy passwords to complex ones at the comfort of your program.  
# I also Built a calculator for to give the Average and also one for the highest score generator. Where tou enter a list of heights and the highest is given out
## Today I learnt about Python loops
