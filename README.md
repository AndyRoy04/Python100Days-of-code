# Hey everyone, I'm Anderson Roy and Enthusiastic python programmer and I'll be uploading my 100days-of-python code challenge in this repository. 
# So if you're interested in learning, you can go through the various daily challenges and learn something new

## Every single day we do different task and Projects, you'll find a main file for each day if you wanna understand my final project and all what i did on that day. So below you'll see main task of each day of challenge


# Day1 : Band Name Generator 👩🏿‍🤝‍👨🏿

## You enter your pets' name and the city you grew up in and then you get a band name
## Here I mostly did introduction to variables and worked some basic functions.


# Day2 : tip calculator 🧮

## The tip calculator tells you the amount of money you want to give away amybe to servers in a restaurant based on your input percentail and also tells how much everyone is to pay. So the magic behind is :
## Imagine going out with friends and you guys are given a final bill to pay and you decide to donate some money, so it calculates the tip by taking the percentile give away of you final amount, calculates the final amount to be payed by adding the tip to it and tells how much everyone is to pay.
## I also built a BMI(Body Mass Index) calculator and a life in weeks prediction. This ones were just interactive task but fun 😊
## Here I understood data types and how to manipulate strings


# Day3 : Treasure Island  Game🗺️

## The treasure island is game that prompts the user to make choice from some given options and based on the users choice, it tells if he can moved forward or if he/she has crashed.
# Additional tasks were ## Love Calculator which gives th amtching percentage of 2 individuals
# My first pizza calculator
# Updated the BMI calculator, A leap yaer predictor and Roller coster Game.
## I was dealing with control flow, Logical operators and conditional statements


# Day4 : Rock, Paper, Scissors Game ✊🏿🤚🏿✌🏿

## I'm preety sure everyone knows how the Rock, Paper, Scissors game functions but in this case you play with the computer. You'll find the main code and the commented code which all perform same task
# I also Built a ## Head or Coin game
# A Pay bill game where you enter a list of people and the computer randomly chooses who pays the final bill
# Also, I built a treasure guess game where the user guesses where the treasure was placed
## Here I mostly learned about python lists and randomisation


# Day5 : Random Password Generator 🕳️❓

## From the name, you should already guess what it does. We always get things like people hacked into our accounts and all other things dealing with unethical hacking. So I thought and thought on my todays challenge and decided to share this amazing program with you. In this program, you choose the number letters, numbers and symbols you want in your password and random password is generated every single time you ask. So what do you think about this, changing all your easy passwords to complex ones at the comfort of your program.  
# I also Built a calculator for to give the Average and also one for the highest score generator. Where tou enter a list of heights and the highest is given out
## Today I learnt about Python loops


# Day6 : Reeborgs_world 📖

## Today I just wrote a program with the use of inbuilt funtions and I also wrote my own functions. It runs only on the Reeborg python compiler on reeborg.ca.
It's perfectly performant on the following games Hurdle and Maze. Try it out you'll have fun. 
Today was full of python functions.


# Day7 : Hangman ⚖️

## Hangman is just a guess a word game. Hangman comes from the output of the game. In this we have a list of random words where the computer choses one at random and you are asked to guess the letter by guessing letters. In the case where you can guess a letter in the word, a poor man is been hung till you lose the game 
I also creadted my first modeule that I later imported in the main program.
Today was full of python functions.


# Day8 : Caesar Cipher 👨🏿‍💻

## Have you ever wanted to know about ciphers? Then you'll like starting off with Caesar's cipher. Caesar cipher mostly deals with letters. An encoded text is gotten when a plain text is passed as input an all its chars are shifted X directions left or right. This gives a text that is not readable and can only be decoded with the primary key
Read more :  A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on. like below

## I learned function parameters and arguements


# Day9 : Auction Bid 🔨

## The auctiion bid game is a trickish but quite interesting game since it has to do with looping through a dictionary. So basically a Bidder enters his/her bid and then tells the computer if there are other bidders around. When all bidders have set their bids, there's a function created to loop through a dictionary and get the highest bidders name and the bidders bid and then display

Other task are Grading system which takes student grade and attribute them different gradings, there's also a dictionary list where you enter some given parameters and they are then saved into an already existing list

## From all this, I fill like this is a great start to understanding how NoSQL Databases work

## I Learned about Python dictionaries and nesting


# Day10 : Simple Calculator 🧮

## The Day10 project was to build a simple calculator that does basic math functions. We all know the functioning of a calculator. It takes in 2 variable and an operation and solves for a subsiquent output and asks if the user is willing to continue with the previous calculation 

I also built a day in month calculator that tells you the number of days in a given month respective of if it's a leap year or not

## I mostly learned and worked with functions and how to write Docstrings within a function with outputs 


# Day11 : Blackjack or 21 🎴🃏

## The blackjack - also called '21' is a classic casino card game of luck and skill!.On this, we shall have a dealer and player(s). There're several rules to this game and I'll jsut provide some tips. 
1. When the value of dealer's revealed card is 4,5 or 6, it may be fruitful to double your bet with an Ace and 4 in hand.
2. You may want to surrender if you have 16 in your hand while the dealer has a 9,10 or A since picking a card might prompt you to failing.
3. If you get a pair of 7s, only press hit if the dealer has 8,9,10 or Ace.
<!-- Some fue more details about the game -->
Card Values: In blackjack, each card has a specific value. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, depending on which value is more beneficial for the player.
   - Hit: The player can ask for another card to be added to their hand. They can continue hitting until they are satisfied with their hand or they exceed a total hand value of 21, known as "busting." If a player busts, they lose the hand.

   - Stand: The player can choose to stand, which means they are satisfied with their current hand and do not want any more cards.

   - Double Down: In some variations, players may have the option to double down. This involves doubling their original bet and receiving one final card.

   - Split: If the player's first two cards are of the same rank (e.g., two 8s), they may choose to split their hand into two separate hands. Each hand is then played independently, with an additional bet for the second hand.

## On todays project I'm to put in my knowledge of previous work and projects done to go through this fun game.
